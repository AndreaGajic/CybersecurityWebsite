      <h3>
        Intro
      </h3>
      <p>
        Linux is a family of open-source operating systems that resemble the
        UNIX operating system. Open-source means the source code for the Linux
        kernel is freely distributed and anyone can modify it. It is based on
        the Linux kernel released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds,a
        student at the Univeristy of Helsinki. Linux has a variety of
        distributions, which are the operating systems created by modifying the
        kernel in some way. Common Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora,
        Debian, and Linux Mint.
      </p>

      <p>
        Linux mostly uses the command line, rather than the Graphical User
        Interface (GUI) like Windows does. This means most commands such as
        editing files, installing programs, and securing the operating system
        are run in the terminal.

      <h3>
        Sudo
      </h3>
      <p>
        Similar to the 'Run as Administrator' action in Windows GUI, Linux can
        also give users Administrator privileges. This is done by using the
        'sudo' command in the terminal. One can obtain superuser privilegs by
        runnign 'sudo su' or just make administrator changes by typing 'sudo'
        before the rest of the command.
      </p>
      <p>
        A best practice is to ensure a password is required to run sudo. This
        prevents users that should not have administrator privileges from
        getting them.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Password Requirements in /etc/login.defs
      </h3>
      <p>
        An important security file in Linux is the /etc/login.defs file. This is
        where password settings are located. The following settings should be
        configured in your /etc/login.defs file. They will set the minimum and
        maximum number of days you can keep the same password, and when it will
        warn you your password will need to be changed soon. The encryption
        method for passwords is also configured here. The numbers configured
        here are the reccommended values for a secure operating system.
