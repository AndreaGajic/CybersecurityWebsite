      <h3>
        Intro
      </h3>
      <p>
        Windows is a collection of operating systems created and marketed by
        Microsoft. It is one of the most popular ooperating systems for personal
        computers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows is a graphical operating system, and relies on Graphical User
        Interface (GUI) to run. This means that unlike Linux, most actions can
        be completed wihtout the use of a terminal, making it more user-friendly
        to some. Unlike Linux, it has all settings and computer configurations
        available for editing through a graphical interface, with no file
        editing necessary.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Account Type
      </h3>
      <p>
        To prevent all users from using administrator access, only those who
        will require it in day-to-day tasks should be given the administrator
        role. All other users should be given the 'standard' account type. This
        is set in the Control Panel under User Accounts. You select an account
        and with administrator privileges can elect to change its type.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Firewall
      </h3>
      <p>
        Another very important thing in the Windows operating systems is the
        Firewall. It should be turned on for both private network connections
        and public network connections. It is the first line of defense of an
        operating system and can stop harmful connections from being established
        to your computer.

      <h3>
        Anti-Virus
      </h3>
      <p>
        A best practice for your Windows system is to install a trusted
        anti-virus such as 360 Total Security. The anti-virus will detect,
        prevent, and remove malware before it can harm your computer. It is
        something that is often overlooked, but can save you a headache down the
        line.
